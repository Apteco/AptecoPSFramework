- Update upward compatibility when there are new features and setting possibilites
- Errorhandling and causing stop of campaigns on problems
- Installation of dependencies
- Developer mode to quickly create own integrations
- Secure encryption of tokens and credentials
- Possibility to develop cmdlets that can be executed directly in PowerShell e.g. to start clean up jobs or download specific data from an integration...
- Easy boilerplate, documentation on GitHub and Demo-Channel to start quickly
- Easy updates via PowerShellGallery
- Easy integration of proxies, custom headers, REST handling
- Using secure oAuth for connected apps like Microsoft Dynamics, Salesforce SalesCloud and CleverReach
- Using DuckDB by default since 0.3.0 to allow easy data transformation
- Much more to follow...

Your help is appreciated. Just contact me.
