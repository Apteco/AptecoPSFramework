# Apteco Customs - AptecoPSFramework

This framework is mainly created for installing and using custom channels in Apteco Orbit and PeopleStage. The channel implementations are written in PowerShell and already implemented as "Plugins" in this module. But there is a function implemented so you can refer to your own channels that are not getting overwritten if you update this module. The development of this module is done here, but it is published through [PowerShell Gallery](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages?q=%23apteco).

# Installation / Update / Uninstall

This has been put into the wiki: https://github.com/Apteco/AptecoPSFramework/wiki/Installation-and-Update

But this is the Quickstart

```PowerShell
install-module PackageManagement -MinimumVersion 1.4  -Force -AllowClobber
install-module PowerShellGet -MinimumVersion 2.0  -Force -AllowClobber
Install-Module WriteLog
Install-Script Install-Dependencies
Install-Module AptecoPSFramework
Import-Module AptecoPSFramework
Install-AptecoPSFramework -Verbose
```

If you have downloaded this repository as zip file directly from github, you maybe need to unblock all files first. This is something you can do like this, when you go to the directory where you extracted the files to:

```PowerShell
Get-ChildItem -Path "." -Recurse -Include "*.ps1","*.psm1","*.psd1" | % { Unblock-File $_.FullName }
```

# Getting started with the Framework

After the installation you are reade to use this module and create a settings json file and connect that with your Apteco system. So please import your module like 

```PowerShell
Import-Module AptecoPSFramework -Verbose
```

If you get error messages during the import, that is normal, because there are modules missing yet. They need to be installed with `Install-AptecoPSFramework`

Please go ahead to a directory where the script files should be placed like `D:\Scripts\AptecoPSFramework`. Then you can now start the installation

```PowerShell
Install-AptecoPSFramework -Verbose
```

This command installs dependencies like scripts, modules and nuget packages. After installing the dependencies it copies a "Boilerplate" into your current directory and gives you more hints about how to connect this "Boilerplate" with a PeopleStage PowerShell channel.





Now you should find a `create_settings.ps1` file in your boilerplate folder. Please execute this one to create a new `settings.json` file with

```PowerShell
. .\create_settings.ps1
```




# Getting started with Plugins

You are able to use already integrated plugins, but can also develop your own plugins and load it via this module and use the already existing framework with logging, error handling, encryption and much more comfort. The idea is to have a `settings.json` which can also have a different name. That file contains all information to drive the module and integration with Apteco. You can have as many settings files for the same or different plugins as you want.

Please consider to create a channel multiple times, e.g. for every table level.

## Create your settings json/yaml file

The first target is to create your settings file, because that contains all the information that the module needs for being triggered by PeopleStage. In the boiletplate you can find a rough example of how to create that file. But specific for the chosen plugins you can set more or less parameters. They can be changed through that `create_settings.ps1` script or later in your file. It depends on how often you change the settings file. This path to the settings file needs to be exchanged in the channel editor settings in the integration parameter. This needs to be an absolute path.

Tool tip: If you want to visualise (and edit) the JSON, this tool can help: https://jsoncrack.com/editor

If you are using yaml, it is just simple to read.

```PowerShell

#-----------------------------------------------
# IMPORT THE FRAMEWORK MODULE
#-----------------------------------------------

Import-Module "AptecoPSFramework"


#-----------------------------------------------
# CHOOSE A PLUGIN
#-----------------------------------------------

$plugin = @(, (get-plugins | Select guid, name, version, update, path | Out-GridView -PassThru ))

If ($plugin.count -gt 1) {
    Write-Host "Sorry, you have chosen more than 1 plugin"
    exit 1
} elseif ( $plugin.count -eq 0 ) {
    Write-Host "Sorry, you have chosen less than 1 plugin"
    exit 1
}


#-----------------------------------------------
# LOAD THE PLUGIN
#-----------------------------------------------

Import-Plugin -guid $plugin.guid


#-----------------------------------------------
# LOAD THE SETTINGS (GLOBAL + PLUGIN)
#-----------------------------------------------

$settings = Get-settings
#$settings.pluginGuid = $plugin.guid


#-----------------------------------------------
# CHANGE PARAMETERS
#-----------------------------------------------

$settings.logfile = ".\file.log"

# Specific for CleverReach just as an example, it is commented out currently
<#
$settings.token.tokenUsage = "consume"
$settings.token.tokenFilePath = "D:\Scripts\CleverReach\check-token\cr.token"
#>


#-----------------------------------------------
# SET AND EXPORT SETTINGS
#-----------------------------------------------

Set-Settings -PSCustom $settings
Export-Settings -Path ".\settings.yaml"
```


## Create your own plugin or change an existing one

These steps are needed

1. Get a copy of the demo plugin as a template or get another plugin from this modules folder
1. Open the `Plugin.ps1` and exchange the guid with a new random one like `[guid]::NewGuid().ToString()`
1. Go through the different files and change the code. Please be aware to not touch the functions names in the `peoplestage` folder


Please have a look at the [Demo channel](plugins/Demo) as a kind of template/boilerplate to start with. The guid needs to be changed in the `Plugin.ps1` to allow loading the plugin, but that is explained later.

Please note that the plugin that gets dynamically created when calling `import-plugin`, a copy of the internal variables is used. So after `import-plugin` all changes in the imported module don't have an effect to the dynamic plugin.

Please think about a [pull request](https://github.com/Apteco/AptecoPSModules/pulls) if you want to add more integrations into this repository

The structure for the plugin folder should look like this

Mandatory|Folder|Filename|Description
-|-|-|-
yes|.|ReadMe.md|Description about this plugin
yes|.|Plugin.ps1|Metadata about the plugin. The filename should always be `Plugin.ps1`. If you create a new plugin, the guid needs to be recreated. Output a new guid with `[guid]::newGuid().toString()`
yes|./settings|defaultsettings.ps1|These settings are plugin dependent and will be merged with the overall settings
no|./public/setup|install-plugin.ps1|This script does a plugin dependent installation
no|./public/peoplestage|test-login.ps1|Script to test the login via channel editor
yes|./public/peoplestage|get-messages.ps1|Script to load messages
no|./public/peoplestage|get-groups.ps1|Script to load groups or lists
yes|./public/peoplestage|invoke-upload.ps1|Script to upload records into a group or list
no|./public/peoplestage|invoke-broadcast.ps1|Script to trigger/broadcast a message (not needed for "upload only")
no|./public/peoplestage|show-preview.ps1|Script to render a message as html

Generally the `private` folder is for internal functions that are used by the plugin, but are not usable in your PowerShell session. The `public` folders functions are exported to your sessions, which means you can use them as CmdLets automatically after the plugin has been loaded.


### Loading your plugin

You do not need to put the plugin back to the modules folders, otherwise it can be deleted or overwritten with an update. Use this command to define your own plugins root directory after `Import-Module AptecoPSFramework`

```PowerShell
Add-PluginFolder -Folder "C:\temp\plugins"
Register-Plugins
```

After you have added the directory and re-registered all plugins you should see a combination of the default plugins and your new developed one with

```PowerShell
Get-Plugins
```

After you have seen the list of plugins there are multiple ways to choose one manually with an `Get-Plugins | Out-GridView -PassThrough` or just copy the guid. Choose the plugin for the module with something similar like

```PowerShell
Import-Plugin -guid "07f5de5b-1c83-4300-8f17-063a5fdec901"
```

### Use plugin specific functionality

There are default functionalities per plugin like `get-messages`, `invoke-upload` etc. But there are maybe more functionalities that could be useful. To use this you can find in the `Plugin.ps1` a class, that is automatically loaded into the module, when importing the plugin. So you could do something like

```PowerShell
Import-Module AptecoPSFramework -Verbose
Set-DebugMode -DebugMode $true          # Not necessarily needed, only for testing purposes
Import-Settings -Path ".\settings.json" # The plugin gets automatically loaded from the json file

# Now you can execute plugin specific commands you can see with
Get-Module | Format-List

# And get a result like
<#

# DuckDB support

Since version `0.3.0` this module integrates DuckDB out-of-the-box, if you run `Install-AptecoPSFramework`. This downloads a few modules into a local "lib" folder.

This folder should be the folder, where you put your settings json/yaml files.

## Using DuckDB from CLI

This is a quick start example to use DuckDB

```PowerShell
# this should be the place where you have your json/yaml settings files and your lib folder
Set-Location "c:\Users\MMustermann\Scripts\AptecoPSFramework" 

# Import the Framework
Import-Module AptecoPSFramework

# Load Dependencies without loading a plugin
# Loading a plugin will automatically load the packages in that folder
Import-Lib

<#

You should see something in the console like

WARNING: There is no variable '$processId' present on 'Script' scope. Created one with
'bd8a69ce-0795-4f0a-b5ea-395c54473f60'
VERBOSE: ----------------------------------------------------
VERBOSE: Using PowerShell version 5.1.22621.3672 and Desktop edition
VERBOSE: Using OS: Windows

#>

# Open the connection to the default DuckDB database
# You can also use Add-DuckDBConnection for more connections, but Open-DuckDBConnection
# will add the default connection from settings automatically
Open-DuckDBConnection

# Perform a simple scalar query, which returns just a number
Read-DuckDBQueryAsScalar -Query "Select 10+15"

# Should return 25

# Perform a more advanced example to load a remote parquet file and query it in one go
$q = "CREATE TABLE train_services AS FROM 's3://duckdb-blobs/train_services.parquet';SELECT * FROM train_services LIMIT 10;"
Read-DuckDBQueryAsReader $q -ReturnAsPSCustom | ft

# Instead of the combined command you could do it also separately
Invoke-DuckDBQueryAsNonExecute -Query "CREATE TABLE train_services AS FROM 's3://duckdb-blobs/train_services.parquet'"
Read-DuckDBQueryAsReader -Query "SELECT * FROM train_services LIMIT 10" -ReturnAsPSCustom | ft

# To stream data of a bigger resultset, you should add the -AsStream switch like
Read-DuckDBQueryAsReader -Query "SELECT * FROM train_services LIMIT 10" -ReturnAsPSCustom -AsStream

# Close default connection
Close-DuckDBConnection 

```

To do something directly with a sqlite database (instead of attaching it in the query), you can do something like this

```PowerShell
# Make sure you have the sqlite extension installed
Invoke-DuckDBQueryAsNonExecute -Query "INSTALL sqlite"

# Add a sqlite database directly in the connection string
Add-DuckDBConnection -Name "Aachen" -ConnectionString "DataSource=C:\Users\WDAGUtilityAccount\Downloads\ac.sqlite;ACCESS_MODE=READ_ONLY"

# Open the database connection
Open-DuckDBConnection -Name "Aachen"

# Show first 10 rows of the table and show as Out-GridView
Read-DuckDBQueryAsReader -Query "SELECT * FROM ac LIMIT 10" -ReturnAsPSCustom -ConnectionName "Aachen" | Out-GridView

# Close connection
Close-DuckDBConnection -Name "Aachen"

```

You can influence the database (default in-memory, but could also be a persistent one) by changing your settings at `defaultDuckDBConnection`

## Using DuckDB from Orbit/PeopleStage

Be aware that when Orbit/PeopleStage are calling PowerShell, this is currently 32bit and DuckDB is 64bit only. For this case you can put
another parameter in your `IntegrationParameters` in your channel to enforce 64bit. To do this, this parameter needs to be defined like
`settingsFile=C:\Apteco\Scripts\AptecoPSFramework\settings.yaml;Force64bit=true` or similar.

## Using DuckDB to work with csv files

To find out more about the csv file and their columns, you could do

```PowerShell
Import-Module AptecoPSFramework
Import-Settings ".\inx.yaml"
Open-DuckDBConnection

# Count the rows in a file
$c = Read-DuckDBQueryAsScalar -Query "Select count(*) from read_csv('.\test.txt', sample_size=1000, delim='\t')"


# This query then trys to find out more about the csv file like the delimiter, headers, date formats, column data types and much more
# The delimiter does not need to be defined explicitely, it expects UTF-8
$c = Read-DuckDBQueryAsReader -Query "Select * from sniff_csv('.\test.txt', sample_size=1000, delim='\t') limit 10" -ReturnAsPSCustom

# Read a csv file as an array of pscustom objects
$c = Read-DuckDBQueryAsReader -Query "Select * from sniff_csv('.\test.txt', delim='\t')" -ReturnAsPSCustom -AsStream
```

# Errors

## Die Eingabezeichenfolge hat das falsche Format

When you get this error

```PowerShell
PS C:\Users\Administrator> find-module aptecopsframework -IncludeDependencies -AllVersions
Der Wert "0.0.17-alpha" kann nicht in den Typ "System.Version" konvertiert werden. Fehler: "Die Eingabezeichenfolge
hat das falsche Format."
```

Please install a newer version of `PowerShellGet`

```PowerShell
Install-Module PowerShellGet -Force -AllowClobber
```

## Channel not working after update

Please restart your FastStats service if you have problems after an update.

## Unable to get messages with Exception / Unable to get lists with Exception

This should not happen, but shows that your PSModulePath cannot be loaded properly from C# runspaces.

To manually fix this, just add `C:\Program Files\WindowsPowerShell\Modules` to the system environment variable `PSModulePath`

## Missing dependency, execute: 'Install-Script Install-Dependencies'

There is a script missing to install other dependencies. To solve this, simply run

```PowerShell
Install-Script Install-Dependencies
```

open a new PowerShell window and after that you can proceed with your installation like

```PowerShell
Import-Module AptecoPSFramework
Install-AptecoPSFramework
```

## DuckDB cannot be opened

Since 0.3.0 there is DuckDB integrated in this framework. If you have problems to get it work like

```PowerShell
Import-Module AptecoPSFramework
Open-DuckDBConnection
```

and it fails with something like

```PowerShell
PS C:\Users\WDAGUtilityAccount> Open-DuckDBConnection
Exception calling "Open" with "0" argument(s): "The type initializer for
'DuckDB.NET.Data.DuckDBConnectionStringBuilder' threw an exception."
At C:\Users\WDAGUtilityAccount\Downloads\AptecoPSFramework\public\duckdb\Open-DuckDBConnection.ps1:18 char:13
+             $Script:duckDb.Open()
+             ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    + CategoryInfo          : NotSpecified: (:) [], MethodInvocationException
    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : TypeInitializationException
```

then you need to install the newest version of `vcredist` from: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170

The direct permalink is: https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe

If you already have installed the AptecoPSFramework, make sure to re-install the dependencies in your settings file directory with `Install-AptecoPSFramework`

## There was no parameter found named "-Destination"

This message could be slightly different. But this results from an older 32 bit package of `Packagemanagement` that comes with Windows. And that one is outdated and not supported by this Framework. Make sure you have a newer version available. Best is to open a PowerShell as Administrator and install it via `Install-Module "PackageManagement" -Scope AllUsers`. Or update an existing one with `Update-Module PackageManagement`. Because when PowerShell is called via C#, it can load the older PackageManagement. You can safely remove it from `C:\Program Files (x86)\WindowsPowerShell\Modules`. The new installed one should be in `C:\Program Files\WindowsPowerShell\Modules`.

## Channel is working from PowerShell, but not from Apteco FastStats Service

Then it might be, that the FastStats Service is not running with a service user. It may be `network service` or `local system`. But those users are not able to decrypt encrypted credentials. So your service should run with a specified service user.

## set-packagesource : Source Location 'https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json' is not valid.

Then you already have a nuget repository that does not work as expected. Just add it with this and try to execute the installation again:

```PowerShell
Register-PackageSource -Name "NuGet v2" -Location "https://www.nuget.org/api/v2" -ProviderName "NuGet"
Install-AptecoPSFramework -verbose
```

## Some files are blocked

Especially when you download the `*.ps1` files directly or in a zip file and unzip it with windows integrated tools, then the files get blocked. To Unblock them, this command is useful

```PowerShell
Set-Location "C:\...."
get-childitem -Recurse -Include "*.ps1" | Unblock-File
```
